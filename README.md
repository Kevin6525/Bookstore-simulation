# Bookstore-simulation
The following program is intended to simulate profits for a college bookstore depending on the following factors:
1. Is the book required or suggested (depending on user input)
2. The price of the book (depending on user input)
3. The amount of copies needed (how many students are in the class)
4. Is the book a new book or an old book
The program makes the following assumptions in its calculations:
1. If the book is required and new, not all students will purchase the book but 90% of the students will
2. If the book is old and required, 65% of students will buy the book
3. If the book is old and suggested, only 20% of students will buy the book
4. If the book is new and suggested, only 40% of students will buy the book
